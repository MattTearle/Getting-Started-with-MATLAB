Example MATLAB scripts for the solar panel example shown in the "Getting Started with MATLAB" video

Data is in the spreadsheet SolarArrayProduction.xlsx. This consists of recorded electricity production from two MathWorks solar panel arrays, recorded every 15 minutes for the month of June, 2018.

The script developed in the video is solarproduction_model.mlx.

Examples of extra data analysis tasks are shown in solarproduction_analysis.mlx. Some sections of this script require Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox(TM).
